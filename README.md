# CompareSpreadSheets
Python excel parser that will find the items in a spreadsheet by a list of given ItemId's

This was a quick parsing program that I put together to find the associated ItemId and all cells in that row from an Excel spreadsheet
with over 18,000 rows and rows of varying length, with a given list of ItemId's in an Excel spreadsheet.  The program then creates a new
Excel spreadsheet with all the matching rows.
